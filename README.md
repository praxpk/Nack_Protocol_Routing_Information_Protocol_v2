Run each Rover.java program on a separate machine/vm/docker instance.
Assign a fictitious ip address to each rover. If you wish to transfer
a file to another instance, mention its fictitious ip address and
the file you wish to transfer in the arguments.

java Rover fictitious_ip_address [destination_ip file_name]
